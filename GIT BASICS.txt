NEVER USED GIT BEFORE,the first step is
1.Configuring your name and email(setup).
	EXECUTE:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@whatever.com"
i love git

...This allows git know your name and email.
WHY?a) Git associates commits with your email address, allowing you to track changes and understand
who made which changes to the codebase when you commit them to a Git repository.
    b)Git uses passwords for authentication with remote repositories over HTTP or HTTPS protocols,
ensuring only authorized users can interact with the repository.

2.Setting-up line ending preferences
WINDOW USERS:
	EXECUTE:
git config --global core.autocrlf true
git config --global core.safecrlf true
MAC&UNIX USERS:
	EXECUTE:
git config --global core.autocrlf input
git config --global core.safecrlf true

WHY?This ensures consistency across different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux, 
preventing version control issues, build failures, and collaboration problems. Git allows 
developers to configure line ending handling, enabling automatic conversion of line endings to 
a specific style during file check-in or out, enhancing collaborative workflow efficiency.
